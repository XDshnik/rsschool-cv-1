                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I have a concept of the work of various types of web programming. 
                For a year and a half I was engaged in self-study in this direction and would like to connect my life with this.
                I took this course last fall, this time Iâ€™m going to get to the end 
                I know how to search for the information I need, I like to solve the tasks set for me. Not without this, I soon began to layout my first web page</p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>I tried myself as a layout designer, created and laid out the main menu of the site.
