 * ## Interests
 I have a concept of the work of various types of web programming. 
 For a year and a half I was engaged in self-study in this direction and would like to connect my life with this.
 I took this course last fall, this time I'm going to get to the end 
 I know how to search for the information I need, I like to solve the tasks set for me. Not without this, I soon began to layout my first web page
 * ## Skills
 I tried myself as a layout designer, created and laid out the main menu of the site. [*my_first_try*](https://alexeybobkovv.github.io/First-try/)
 With my friends I programmed my robot in arduino for a college competition.
 * ## Code examples 
  * [*15-game*](https://alexeybobkovv.github.io/15th-Game/) - a game made by me in an attempt to catch up with the course program
  * [*momentum*](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/alexeybobkovv-JS2020Q3/momentum/) - one of the programs to which I have a link from the previous set
